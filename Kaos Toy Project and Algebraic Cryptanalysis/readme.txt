Toy Project.
------------

Welcome to my small Toy Project. ;) In a rainy autumn evening I was bored,  
so I decided to code a small keygenme. Keygenme itself is not hard. 
The challenge is in making reasonably fast keygen. ;)

With "no brain, no pain" approach probably you can bruteforce one unlock code in 30 days.
With pen and paper probably you can calculate one unlock code in 30 minutes.
Now make a keygen which generates any unlock code in 30 miliseconds!

Accepted solution: 
   Only keygen. Your keygen must generate valid unlock code for *any* activation code for *any* PC.

Rules: 
   Generating unlock code should not take more than 1 second on reasonably old PC.
   No patching, no self-keygen, no serial sniffing.
   Have fun!

Rating:
  "bronze medal" - calculating Unlock Code for Installation ID = "6E8368B7F2D12097-CF359EAF9987CA1C-9ACC05AB74BF46CB-5713384976D5A3A4". 
                   You can use this "Unlock Code" (in uppercase) to extract source of keygenme.
  "silver medal" - making keygen for any Installation ID.
  "gold medal"   - keygen + decoder that extracts disk serial number from "Installation ID".

Enjoy!
